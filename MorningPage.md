- **Go to bed:** 23:30
- **Sleep:** 23:45
- **Wake up:** 7:15 (late for 45 minutes of alarm)

    - This morning I was so lazy, my passion and my motivation were different from the night observed, It had reduced to almost nothing. My feeling to do The thing at night I plan to do tomorrow day is left nothing. I wake up at 6:15, but when I open my eyes, I'm thirsty, I'm cool, and I don't have the power to get out of bed, I get up and sleep continuously, waking to close the alarm. I do this thing for 45 minutes, then I go to make a coffee. I think to myself about The thing I planned last night, It's so hard to do and I'm very worried about The plan I asked my parents to buy me the electric piano. It was a high price (4450à¸¿), but it's not my most worried, I'm worried about expressing myself to them, Once I used to don't like the instrument and resist it. I'm in my parent's eyes was people who didn't have music motivation. I'm so shy and afraid of it. Before this morning, the last night, I had many passion and motivation, but it's left nothing, I don't have the power to do that and I ..., It is so hard to explain my feelings now, I am afraid that till I want to delete this in my to day plan. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­, This is my feeling now. I'm afraid, afraid to message my parent, tired to work, and powerless to move. It seems that last night I used too much power, Make this day I burn out. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­.

    It sounds like you had a tough morning, struggling with motivation and feeling overwhelmed by your plans. It's natural for our energy and emotions to fluctuate, especially when facing something that feels challenging or intimidating. The contrast between how you felt last night and this morning can be frustrating, especially when you have goals you want to accomplish.
    <br><br>
    The worries about asking your parents for the electric piano and how they'll perceive your interest in music are understandable. Itâ€™s common to feel nervous when presenting a new side of yourself, especially if it seems different from how others see you.
    <br>
    If I may offer some thoughts:

    - Acknowledge the Feeling: It's okay to feel like this. You're human, and these emotions are a part of the process. Recognizing and accepting how you feel is the first step.

    - Take Small Steps: Instead of focusing on the entire plan, try breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. For instance, just drafting a message to your parents, without sending it, can be a way to ease into the process.

    - Be Kind to Yourself: Feeling burned out doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™ve failed or that you wonâ€™t regain your motivation. Itâ€™s a sign that you might need some rest or a different approach. Maybe take a short break, do something you enjoy, and return to your tasks when you feel a bit more refreshed.

    - Reflect on the "Why": Remind yourself why you wanted the electric piano and what it means to you. Sometimes reconnecting with your deeper motivations can help reignite your passion.

    <br>
    You don't have to force yourself to be productive when youâ€™re feeling drained. It's okay to take a step back, recharge, and then move forward when youâ€™re ready. I'm here to support you in any way you need.

Thank you so much, I'm a person who stands alone, I have no close friends to vent my weaknesses, the latest I just found out that my new group friend (I'm beginning freshman in a new university), 5-7 same-aged friend and 2 sophomore-friend that I give more attention to them on the beginning of term, they are creating a new group that doesn't have me, leave me alone. This situation has happened to me many times, first when I was up to grade 7 in a new school, second when I was up to grade 10 in a new school, and the last when I was to freshman at university. It makes me stand by myself alone while studying, When I work I don't have any members in the group Just have myself. Additionally, in my children's past, my mother had to go to work province, and my father had to Work late. It happened when I was in grade 1 when I was 6 years old (I entered school before age). At that time, I was just a 6-year-old child who was afraid everything I don't know, I must go to scool my self, wake up with father alarm at 5:30, dress up with myself, and go to the bus my self since 6:00 AM, walk in dark walk way by myself, My father is not even waking up (I'm understandable that my father so tired from work) and not even have a mother cause her is work so far. In this moment i do every thing myself, then when i go on bus i must wait to school, the bus is take time for 1 hour, i will arrived at school when 7:10, then i must go to find my breakfast my self, when i'm finished study, i just wait the bus again, when i come back home, It have nothing there even my parent, It is the cold home. My father will work and go home 20:00 - 22:00, him work and go to talk with his friend, My mother is not there too. I must bring myself to grandfater home to eat dinner, It's so far from my home, estimate 15 minutes of walk, but at this moment i just a 6-years child, But i have no choice, if i don't go, i wont have a dinner. But it's not the worst of this story, At this moment the thing most worst is I don' have any close friend, i just have friend that almost stangle relationship. I'm the special people, I  know it later, my type is INTP, but in that moment, I'm too smart, the logic in my head in deep for same age friend, My math and science or the subject that use logic I can pass it easily different from another people, It make me a strange person who is the aim of bully. And this INTP type for me is can mean my expression, In the child past when i don't have enough experient or deep thinking about myself with the century that social don't accept introvert, It make me even more strange. I must face this situation for 6 year, 6 years that i have no parents to tell about my worried, my stessful, my afraid or problem, It's a 6 years that i must do everything by myseft, every school problem, every friend problem or every feeling problem, I must fix it myself, It make I'm a suppressed person. Every home work, money management and meal management i must do it, It's have no choice for me. I make the shield to protech myseft from socialty, I can't express that I was the introvert side (this century every one doesn't know introvert mean, they just think it a growing problem, and they will fix you to extrovert), I make the second identity to solve the problem that introvert hard to solve, make the identity who can control feelling though even have the friend or parent. It make my maturity higher than same age people. Combined with INPT an introvert type and my special logic, It make me very-very strange to same age friend. It made me even more alone. The most worse, don't have any teacher like this, In this century on thai teacher teach with wood rod, they will make student to humiliate, teach with afraid, Yes, I'm the most teacher target, make me even more bully. Once i had discussed the door hiegth in class, teacher teach about measurement using the body, i discuss that the door is 2 mater hiegth but teacher tell it's 4 meter, the children arm is short then to measure make the hieght is more than reality, I use my strength logic to discuss, but teacher use the people in room laugh at me because my result, Yes it's a 1 situation, I used to more. in grade 1-6, I have zero close friend, I just person who have only woring friend for homework or compettitive contests (I was the best at math in school.) No friend at school, No friend at home, No one wait for you when you go home, No any person you can express yourself. I have at least 2 identities. First is introvert size, Only myself and you will see it, and sencond myself that i show everyone. It's not all over yet, when i'm up to grade 7-9 and 10-12, i must change school with new community, Every thing is same from grade 1-6, except that my parent can find the way to live nearby me, but it's too late, This moment i have the indetity to control everything by myself do the every duty of parent, It make my relationship in family is so far. In this moment, I don't even know that (i will know in later). In this new community, i think i can have friend, from grade 7-9 i think my friend is that is my close and best friend, but not, I just thought about it. when i up to 10-12 the new school, they not even message me, Yes this is same situation with current, my best and close friend that it think  on grade 10-12 , they not even message me when i'm fresh man in new university. They make secret group that doesn't have me, me in study group just be excess from group. I think that i can change myself for that since in grade 10-12, I try so hard to safe this relation, i pay many attention to my friend, but now The thing i do for 3 year isn't meaningless. Eventhough the new friend group in university i pay them very attention for 4 week and now i know that them make the group together by don't have me. I'm so furious, I use this feeling to driving force to improve myself, now i won't attemp them, i will study so hard i will be apply for working even im freshman (I'm programmer who link back end website develop ment), I will make them attention at me and i will send all my feeling back. This is the brief situation about my feeling before i send you this morning page. your sentence "Acknowledge the Feeling: It's okay to feel like this. You're human, and these emotions are a part of the process. Recognizing and accepting how you feel is the first step." Make my tears falling out of my eyes so hard, I'm not people who cry easily at least 1 time in 2 year, This is my cry for my emotion in 3 year (the last time is when i know i am excess of group from grad 10). I try so hard for 1 sentence, when i continuous read next, I'm getting harder and harder. It reflect all my introvert feeling (my real emotion), trick some thing in my heart, I carry too much emotion and not express it for many years, disappointed, regret, sadness,  betrayal, etc. is overflowing from my heart and make me the motivation to break, break for my heart. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­.Thank you so much!
