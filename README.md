## My Projects
- **[Grade 7-9](#my-project-between-grade-7-9)**
    - [Mixer Rubber Imitate Senna Siamea Leaves (Engineering only)](#mixer-rubber-engineering-only)
    - **Description:** Development of a Mixer Rubber Water system using a Senna Siamea leaves model to mix formic acid with rubber for the production of cup rubber. This project aimed to the challenges faced by rubber tappers; swollen rubber, which lowers rubber prices and reduces their income.
    - **Achievements:** 1 Gold and 1 Silver award at the national level.

# My Project Between Grade 7-9

## Mixer Rubber imitate Senna Siamea leaves (Engineering only)
- ### Skills and Technologies Used
    - **Using Skills:**
        - Electrical system design
        - Shape design
    - **Technologies and Tools:**
        - Sketch up software for 3D design
        - Use baterry and switch in electrical system

- ### Problem Statement
    - **Problem:** Traditional rubber tapping methods face inefficiencies due to inadequate   mixing between rubber and acid, leading to reduce quality and price of rubber.
    - **Objective:** Developing a device that mixes rubber and acid more efficiently and quickly will improve the consistency and quality of the rubber, thereby increasing the income for rubber tappers.

- ### Design and Development
    - **Material Details:**
        - Iron spindle and metal sheet propeller.
        - 3V DC Motor for mixing rubber and acid.
        - 3V Battery Holder for 2 AA-size batteries.
        - PVC pipe for the product frame.

    - **Design Process:**
        - The initial concept focused on effective and quick mixing of rubber and formic acid consistently. The propeller imitates the shape of Senna Siamea leaves.
        - Prototyping involved several developments to gather results from various experiments.

    - **Technical Details:**
        - Electrical system designed to control mixing speeds.
        - Shape design optimized for ease of use and durability.
        - Propeller design based on the three-structure of Senna Siamea leaves, developed through experimentation.

- ### Implementation
    - **Construction/Development:** The design was built using durable materials and tested for performance.
    - **Challenges Faced:** Encountered issues with initial mixing efficiency, resolved by redesigning the mixing blades.

- ### Testing and Validation
    - **Original:** Used a stick to mix, the traditional method employed by rubber tappers.
        - Product price: Free.
        - Time used: 7.58 seconds.
        - Swollen rubber: 70%.
        - Summary of rubber price: Decreased by 2000-3000฿/kg.
        - Weakness: Low mixing efficiency.

    - **Version 1:** Used a motor stick to mix (no propeller yet). It has an acid storage at the bottom of the device.
        - Product price: 100฿.
        - Time used: 4.61 seconds.
        - Summary of rubber price: Decreased by 2000-3000฿/kg.
        - Swollen rubber: 20%.
        - Weakness: Large and bulky, still low mixing efficiency.

    - **Version 2 (Best Version):** Used a motor stick to mix with a tree branch-shaped propeller. This version removed the acid storage due to its bulkiness and difficulty of use.
        - Product price: 110฿
        - Time used: 2.17 seconds
        - Summary of rubber price: Increased by 2000-3000฿/kg
        - Swollen rubber: 0%
        - Strengths: Convenient and compact, high efficiency, and quick mixing.

    - **Version 3:** Used a motor stick to mix with a Senna Siamea leaf-shaped propeller.
        - Product price: 110฿
        - Time used: 1.49 seconds
        - Summary of rubber price: Increased by 2000-3000฿/kg
        - Swollen rubber: 0%
        - Strengths: Convenient and compact, very high efficiency, and quick mixing. 
        - Weakness: the propeller is little difficult to remove from the rubber, but exchange with mixing speed. (worthwhile to exchange)

    - ### Conclusion
    The Mixer Rubber Imitate Senna Siamea Leaves project successfully increased income for traditional rubber tappers, reduced the time required to mix rubber and acid, and provided a durable solution for practical use. The best version, Version 3, is priced at 110฿, with 0% swollen rubber and a speed of 1.49 seconds per tree. It increased income from rubber by 2,000-3,000฿ compared to the lastest 110฿ version. It is both usable and beneficial for rubber tappers. According to the experiment, this result is due to the design of the mixing propeller, which allows the rubber, water, and acid to mix thoroughly, decreasing the rate of swollen rubber. The imitation of Senna Siamea leaves in Version 3 increased the touching area of the propeller and improved the efficiency of water flow.
