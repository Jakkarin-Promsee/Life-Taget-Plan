        </tr>
        </table>

    - ### Testing and Validation
        The wildfire notification transmitter was successfully tested and can be used in real scenarios. The device demonstrated the ability to withstand forest fire temperatures and endure extreme weather conditions. The only damage observed was to the temperature sensors, which are installed outside the case and the fire shield. This results in a cost of 138฿ per detected forest fire. During the installation height experiment, it was found that the higher the device is placed on a tree, the lower the detected temperature due to the spreading of heat.

    - ### Conclusion
        The wildfire notification transmitter successfully alerts forest fire extinguishing officers and stores data on Google Sheets. The device can be installed in high-risk or hard-to-reach areas as intended. The total cost per device is 2,716฿, with an internet service fee of 350฿ per year and an approximate cost of 138฿ per detected forest fire. The device’s shield can withstand temperatures up to 1800°C and endure extreme weather conditions. The batteries can last approximately 6 months without recharging, which is sufficient for one wildfire season, with a 3-month safety margin to account for deteriorated conditions. The estimated lifespan of the device is around 5 years. 

    - ### Outcomes and Achievements
        - **Awards and Recognition:** Passed the short term capital selection from JSTP (Junior Science Talent Project) - 5,000฿ Project funding.

            - **Technical Details:**
                - Utilizes two microcontroller boards working together via wired connection.
                - Use data science knowled to develop a predictive function with self-learning capabilities, utilizing the maximum memory of 4 MB and 64 KB SRAM (the maximum capacity of NodeMCU ESP8266).
                - Sends notifications via Line using the LineNotification API.
                - Stores data in Google Sheets every 10 minutes, enabling historical data review.


    - ### Challenges Faced
        - **Data Noise**: Noise occurred during communication between the two boards, leading to occasional data inaccuracies. This was solved by sending data twice and verifying that both data sets are identical. If they aren't, the NodeMCU (receiver) sends a signal to the Arduino to resend the data.
        - **Memory Constraints**: The 4MB memory and 64KB SRAM were insufficient for deep calculations. This was resolved by optimizing and reducing the size of calculations.
        - **Network Issues**: The project uses a local school network, which experiences peak usage in the afternoon. This caused problems with sending data to the API and cloud. The issue was addressed by implementing a reconnect loop and using temporary memory to store data that couldn’t be immediately sent.
        - **Water Shield Design**: Ensuring a waterproof shield that could withstand the pH and water waves in the water treatment system was a challenge.

    - ### Testing and Validation
        The wildfire notification transmitter was successfully tested and can be used in real scenarios. The device demonstrated the ability to withstand forest fire temperatures and endure extreme weather conditions. The only damage observed was to the temperature sensors, which are installed outside the case and the fire shield. This results in a cost of 138฿ per detected forest fire. During the installation height experiment, it was found that the higher the device is placed on a tree, the lower the detected temperature due to the spreading of heat.

    - ### Conclusion
        The wildfire notification transmitter successfully alerts forest fire extinguishing officers and stores data on Google Sheets. The device can be installed in high-risk or hard-to-reach areas as intended. The total cost per device is 2,716฿, with an internet service fee of 350฿ per year and an approximate cost of 138฿ per detected forest fire. The device’s shield can withstand temperatures up to 1800°C and endure extreme weather conditions. The batteries can last approximately 6 months without recharging, which is sufficient for one wildfire season, with a 3-month safety margin to account for deteriorated conditions. The estimated lifespan of the device is around 5 years. 

    - ### Outcomes and Achievements
        - **Awards and Recognition:** Passed the short term capital selection from JSTP (Junior Science Talent Project) - 5,000฿ Project funding.
