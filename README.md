- ### Testing and Validation
    - **Original:** Used a stick to mix, the traditional method employed by rubber tappers.
        - Product price: Free.
        - Time used: 7.58 seconds.
        - Swollen rubber: 70%.
        - Summary of rubber price: Decreased by 2000-3000฿/kg.
        - Weakness: Low mixing efficiency.

    - **Version 1:** Used a motor stick to mix (no propeller yet). It has an acid storage at the bottom of the device.
        - Product price: 100฿.
        - Time used: 4.61 seconds.
        - Summary of rubber price: Decreased by 2000-3000฿/kg.
        - Swollen rubber: 20%.
        - Weakness: Large and bulky, still low mixing efficiency.

    - **Version 2 (Best Version):** Used a motor stick to mix with a tree branch-shaped propeller. This version removed the acid storage due to its bulkiness and difficulty of use.
        - Product price: 110฿
        - Time used: 2.17 seconds
        - Summary of rubber price: Increased by 2000-3000฿/kg
        - Swollen rubber: 0%
        - Strengths: Convenient and compact, high efficiency, and quick mixing.

    - **Version 3:** Used a motor stick to mix with a Senna Siamea leaf-shaped propeller.
        - Product price: 110฿
        - Time used: 1.49 seconds
        - Summary of rubber price: Increased by 2000-3000฿/kg
        - Swollen rubber: 0%
        - Strengths: Convenient and compact, very high efficiency, and quick mixing. 
        - Weakness: the propeller is little difficult to remove from the rubber, but exchange with mixing speed. (worthwhile to exchange)

- ### Conclusion
    The Mixer Rubber Imitate Senna Siamea Leaves project successfully increased income for traditional rubber tappers, reduced the time required to mix rubber and acid, and provided a durable solution for practical use. The best version, Version 3, is priced at 110฿, with 0% swollen rubber and a speed of 1.49 seconds per tree. It increased income from rubber by 2,000-3,000฿ compared to the lastest 110฿ version. It is both usable and beneficial for rubber tappers. According to the experiment, this result is due to the design of the mixing propeller, which allows the rubber, water, and acid to mix thoroughly, decreasing the rate of swollen rubber. The imitation of Senna Siamea leaves in Version 3 increased the touching area of the propeller and improved the efficiency of water flow.

- ### Outcomes and Achievements

    - **Awards and Recognition:**
        - Gold Award at National Level
        - Silver Award at National Level
