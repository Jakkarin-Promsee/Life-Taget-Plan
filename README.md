# My Project Between Grade 7-9

## Mixer Rubber imitate Senna Siamea leaves (Engineering only)
- ### Skills and Technologies Used
    - **Using Skills:**
        - Electrical system design
        - Shape design
    - **Technologies and Tools:**
        - Sketch up software for 3D design
        - Use baterry and switch in electrical system

- ### Problem Statement
    - **Problem:** Traditional rubber tapping methods face inefficiencies due to inadequate   mixing between rubber and acid, leading to reduce quality and price of rubber.
    - **Objective:** Developing a device that mixes rubber and acid more efficiently and quickly will improve the consistency and quality of the rubber, thereby increasing the income for rubber tappers.

- ### Design and Development
    - **Material Details:**
        - Iron spindle and metal sheet propeller.
        - 3V DC Motor for mixing rubber and acid.
        - 3V Battery Holder for 2 AA-size batteries.
        - PVC pipe for the product frame.

    - **Design Process:**
        - The initial concept focused on effective and quick mixing of rubber and formic acid consistently. The propeller imitates the shape of Senna Siamea leaves.
        - Prototyping involved several developments to gather results from various experiments.

    - **Technical Details:**
        - Electrical system designed to control mixing speeds.
        - Shape design optimized for ease of use and durability.
        - Propeller design based on the three-structure of Senna Siamea leaves, developed through experimentation.

- ### Implementation
    - **Construction/Development:** The design was built using durable materials and tested for performance.
    - **Challenges Faced:** Encountered issues with initial mixing efficiency, resolved by redesigning the mixing blades.

- ### Product

- ### Testing and Validation
    - **Original:** Used a stick to mix, the traditional method employed by rubber tappers.
        - Product price: Free.
        - Time used: 7.58 seconds.
        - Swollen rubber: 70%.
        - Summary of rubber price: Decreased by 2000-3000฿/kg.
        - Weakness: Low mixing efficiency.

    - **Version 1:** Used a motor stick to mix (no propeller yet). It has an acid storage at the bottom of the device.
        - Product price: 100฿.
        - Time used: 4.61 seconds.
        - Summary of rubber price: Decreased by 2000-3000฿/kg.
        - Swollen rubber: 20%.
        - Weakness: Large and bulky, still low mixing efficiency.

    - **Version 2 (Best Version):** Used a motor stick to mix with a tree branch-shaped propeller. This version removed the acid storage due to its bulkiness and difficulty of use.
        - Product price: 110฿
        - Time used: 2.17 seconds
        - Summary of rubber price: Increased by 2000-3000฿/kg
        - Swollen rubber: 0%
        - Strengths: Convenient and compact, high efficiency, and quick mixing.

    - **Version 3:** Used a motor stick to mix with a Senna Siamea leaf-shaped propeller.
        - Product price: 110฿
        - Time used: 1.49 seconds
        - Summary of rubber price: Increased by 2000-3000฿/kg
        - Swollen rubber: 0%
        - Strengths: Convenient and compact, very high efficiency, and quick mixing. 
        - Weakness: the propeller is difficult to remove from the rubber.

- ### Conclusion
    The Mixer Rubber project successfully addressed key challenges in rubber production, with positive feedback and recognition at national events. Future work may focus on further optimizing the system and exploring additional applications.

- ### Outcomes and Achievements
    - **Results:** The final product successfully improved rubber mixing processes.
    - **Awards and Recognition:**
        - Gold Award at National Level
        - Silver Award at National Level
    - **Certificates**:
