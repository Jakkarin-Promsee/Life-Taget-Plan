# My Projects
- ## **[Freshman (Current)](freshman.md)**

- ## **[Grade 10-12 (Oldest - Lastest)](#my-project-between-grade-10-12-oldest---lastest)**
    - ### [**Water Quality Monitoring and Notification Machine for Increase Efficiency of Water Treatment using Artificial Intelligence (JAP.)**](grade10-12.md#water-quality-monitoring-and-notification-machine-for-increase-efficiency-of-water-treatment-using-artificial-intelligence-japs)
        - **Achievements:** Represented in a presentation to the Prime Minister of Thailand at the Thailand-Japan Student ICE Fair 2022 (national event).
        - **Skills and Technologies Used:**
            - Coding using C language with the Node MCU ESP-8266, working together with Arduino (Microcontroller board).
            - Implementing a water quality calculation system using pH, DO (Dissolved Oxygen), and temperature sensors.
            - Implementing a wireless signal notification system using Line.
            - Implementing an automatic data storage system on the cloud using Google Sheets.
            - Designing an electrical system incorporating pH, DO, gas, and temperature sensors.
            - Designing a 3D model product with water-resistant properties.
        - **Description:** This development aims to increase the efficiency of water treatment systems by using IoT technology to notify water treatment officers via Line when the environmental conditions within the system are harmful to water-treatment bacteria. The project utilizes an artificial intelligence algorithm to calculate water quality using pH, DO (Dissolved Oxygen), and temperature. The development focuses on durability and accuracy.

    - ### [**Era Odyssey, The IDLE Game to provide knowledge about geological time (Moblie)**](grade10-12.md#era-odyssey-the-idle-game-to-provide-knowledge-about-geological-time-moblie)
        - [**Webpage: Main-era-odyssey-ciqb.vercel.app**](https://main-era-odyssey-ciqb.vercel.app/assets/Home.html)
        - **Achievements:** Represented in the presentations at The 3rd PCSHS Science Symposium 2023 and received the Gold Award in the computer presentation category.
        - **Skills and Technologies Used:**
            - Developed an IDLE offline game using C# language with Unity.
            - Designed game database and user experience/user interface (UX/UI).
            - Created teaching media that includes text, manga, and gameplay elements.
            - Conceptualized the game's storyline, main characters, enemies, player skills, materials, and weapons.
            - Drew in-game assets and materials using Procreate.
        - **Description:**  This project aims to create a game centered around creatures from various geological periods. The inspiration comes from the fact that there are very few games that feature ancient creatures (other than dinosaurs), such as *trilobites*, *Benmoulai*, *Regalis*, and the others. Our goal is to develop a game that not only entertains but also educates players about life forms from the early stages of the solar system. The game features a unique skill system based on the four elements, as well as a variety of materials and weapons, all within the IDLE game catagory.
    - ### [**Other Project (Not competing)**](grade10-12.md#my-other-project)

- ## **[Grade 7-9 (Oldest - Lastest)](grade7-9.md#my-project-between-grade-7-9-oldest---lastest)**
    - ### [**Mixer Rubber Imitate Senna Siamea Leaves**](grade7-9.md#mixer-rubber-imitate-senna-siamea-leaves)
        - **Achievements:** 1 Gold and 1 Silver award at the national level.
        - **Skills and Technologies Used:**
            - Engineering only.
            - Electrical system design and 3D design.
        - **Description:** Development of a Mixer Rubber Water system using a Senna Siamea leaves model to mix formic acid with rubber for the production of cup rubber. This project aimed to the challenges faced by rubber tappers; swollen rubber, which lowers rubber prices and reduces their income.
        
    - ### [**Wild fire notifications transmitter remotely**](grade7-9.md#wild-fire-notifications-transmitter-remotely)
        - **Achievements:** Passed the short term capital selection from JSTP (Junior Science Talent Project).
        - **Skills and Technologies Used:**
            - Coding C language with Node MCU ESP-8266 (Micro-controller board).
            - Implementing a wireless signal notification system for remote monitoring using Line.
            - Implementing an automatic data storage system on the cloud using Google Sheets.
            - Designing an electrical system incorporating gas and temperature sensor, antenna module, and lithium battery.
            - Designing a 3D model product with fire-resistant properties.
        - **Description:** This development aims to notify forest fire extinguishing officers in high-risk areas about sparks before they become large wildfires to reduce damage and increase operational efficiency. The development focuses on affordability, durability, and reusability.
